# clustergo


ClusterGo is a ride-pooling coordination app for people who share the same location, such as
university students, office workers, or event attendees. The problem it solves is simple: people
leaving the same place often request separate Uber or Careem rides even when heading in similar
directions.
The app allows users to post ride intentions (pickup point, destination, time, available seats)
and discover others with compatible plans. It does not book rides or handle payments - it just
helps users find matches and coordinate themselves. Phase 1 uses a random as the example
cluster, but the concept works for any group
